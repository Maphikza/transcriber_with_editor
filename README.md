# transcriber_with_editor
This Streamlit App uses Whisper to transcribe uploaded audio files.

I wanted to see if it would be possible to quickly build this transcriber using Streamlit. It worked for the most part but I would say that 
Streamlit was not the right choice for this specific projects. At some point I will remake this app as a Flask app.
